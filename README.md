# E-CommerceWebsite


I Created this E-commerce Website to play around and design a front-end Website that will display a couple of products.

This was created over the span of 2-3 days, viewing multiple youtube videos and trying to pull them all together


Some Challenges I faced:
  1. The Youtube Videos that I used though it was recent, it displayed past versions of Javascript and CSS. Furthermore, some features/buttons that were used where not displayed accurately.
  2. I had to ensure that it would be responsive and be able to react when it was browsed on a different device.

It was over a really fun project. No where close to any legitimate E-commerce website but really a work in progress.
